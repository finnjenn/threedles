    <section id="about-body">
      <h3>The Beginning</h3>
      <p>
        At the tender age of 8, Kurdy's journey into the world of needlework
        began with cross-stitching, a craft that would lay the foundation for a
        lifelong love affair with threads and textures. Progressing through the
        realm of embroidery, she eventually discovered her true artistic calling
        in counted canvas needlework, where she could unlock unparalleled
        results through meticulous stitching.
      </p>
      <p>
        With nearly four decades of experience under her belt, Kurdy's
        dedication to her craft is both a testament to her skill and a
        reflection of her unwavering passion. In 2010, after relocating to the
        picturesque landscapes of Colorado, Threedles Needleart and Designs was
        born. It marked a significant turning point as Kurdy transitioned from
        stitching other artists' designs to creating her own, driven by a desire
        to share unique and inspiring patterns with fellow enthusiasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kurdy's commitment to excellence led her to the National Academy of
        Needlearts (NAN) Teacher Certification program in 2012, a transformative
        journey that she successfully completed in 2015. Since then, she has
        become a respected figure in the needlework community, sharing her
        expertise nationally at seminars hosted by ANG, NAN, and EGA.
        Regionally, she has left her mark both through the Embroiderers Guild of
        America (EGA) and the ANG. Locally, she has guided eager minds at guilds
        and retail shops.
      </p>
      <h3>A Day in the Life of Kurdy</h3>
      <p>
        Beyond the intricate world of needlework, Kurdy's life is a tapestry
        woven with diverse interests. She shares her home with her husband and
        tech-support guru, John, and their gentle-giant German Shepherd, Kiska.
        When not immersed in the art of stitching, Kurdy finds solace in the
        rhythmic strokes of kayaking, the delicate care of her indoor orchids,
        and the nurturing of her greenhouse haven.
      </p>
      <h3>Cleopatra's Eyes - Kurdy's Cherished Design</h3>

        alt="Cat's Eyes - Cleopatra Design"
        id="catsEyes"
      />
      <p>
        Among the many captivating creations that have flowed from Kurdy Biggs'
        nimble fingers, one holds a special place in her heart - "Cat's Eyes -
        Cleopatra." This design stands as a testament to Kurdy's artistic
        prowess and her ability to weave stories with threads.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inspired by the enigmatic allure of Cleopatra and the mesmerizing gaze
        of felines, this design is a harmonious blend of history, elegance, and
        the untamed spirit of cats. Kurdy's meticulous attention to detail is
        evident in every stitch, capturing the essence of Cleopatra's legendary
        beauty and the mysterious depth found in the eyes of a cat.
      </p>
